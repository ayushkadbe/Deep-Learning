BRAIN NEURON WORKING


Dendrites-Soma-Axon.
Input-Process-Output

Axon is connected to multiple Dendrites.

Output of Axon is Input to multiple dendrites.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK


For a network of neurons, we
normally divide it into different layers:
1) first layer that feeds the input into the network is obviously called the input layer. 
2) The set of nodes that
provide the output of the network is
called the output layer.
3) And any sets of nodes in between the input and the output layers are called the hidden
layers. When working with neural networks,


the three main topics that we deal with
are: 
* forward propagation, * backpropagation,
* and activation functions.


===========================
FORWARD PROPAGATION

Forward propagation is the process through which data passes through layers of 
neurons in a neural network from the input layer all the way to the output layer. 

Let's use one neuron and mathematically formulate the way information flows through it.

As shown here, the data flows through each neuron by connections or
the dendrites. Every connection has a specific weight by which the flow of
data is regulated.

Neuron below:
x1 -----w1-------- 
		z = x1.w1 + x2.w2 + b1    =>> a = output = z
x2------w2--------

Explanation:
Here x1 and x2 are the two inputs, they could be an integer or float. When these inputs pass through the
connections, they're adjusted depending
on the connection weights, w1 and w2.

The neuron then processes this information by outputting a weighted sum
of these inputs. It also adds a constant to the sum which is referred to as the bias b1. 

So, z here is the linear combination of the inputs and weights along with the bias, and a is the output
of the network.
==================
Activation function

The activation function of a node in an artificial neural network is a function that calculates the output of the node based on its individual inputs and their weights.
